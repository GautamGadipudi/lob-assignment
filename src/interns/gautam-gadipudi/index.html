                <p>I am Graduate student @ RIT, doing my masters degree in Computer Science. This is my final year at
                    RIT, and I plan to graduate in December 2021.</p>
                <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer and software engineer, passionate about software development,
                    web technologies, big data and of course machine learning.
                    I am actively looking for internships in the field of software development and full stack
                    development for
                    Summer 2021 and Fall 2021.</p>
                <p>Curious about how I greet in real time like above? It's a five line Javascript hack that changes the
                    inner HTML value of desired tag depending on the client's time in his/her browser. See the source

            <div class="section-heading">Background</div>
            <p>Prior to starting my masters degree, I did my bachelors degree also in Computer Science at Manipal
                Institute of Technology back in India. In my final semester there, when I was offered an internship at
                DeltaX, I was finally able to see the big picture of everything I learned in my college. DeltaX is an
                AdTech startup in Bengaluru with their focus on their flagship product - DeltaX platform. During my 6
                months of internship there, I developed a service to fetch the Facebook lead forms from the Facebook
                marketing API, store them in AWS S3 as log files and finally export them to appropriate Google sheets
                using Google sheets API for C#. This added a feature for the clients to be able to view their data
                directly in Google sheets.
            </p>

            <p>After I graduated, I was offered a full time role as a Full Stack Developer at DeltaX, and I worked there
                for close to a year. Since it was a start-up and we worked in an ownership driven kind of environment, I
                got an exposure to the complete tech stack at DeltaX. I was part of the tracking team, where our main
                responsibility was to provide timely and demographic ad performance data using metrics like clicks,
                views, cost per click etc. for the different ads and campaigns of different clients. My learnings from
                there were developing web applications using .NET and Vue.js, and developing microservices using C#,
                testing them using Behavior Driven Development and deploying them using Jenkins and Azure. One
                breakthrough achievement of mine there was to reduce the load time of web pages showing computed grid
                data by a very huge margin - earlier it used to take about a minute to load the grid data for big
                clients with large audience like ClearTrip and Dominos pizza because the SQL query to compute the grid
                data was the bottleneck, but with the implementation of a redis cache to store timely computed data in
                it, I was able to reduce the load time to a couple of seconds.
            </p>

            <p>
                A few skills that I am proud of:

            <ul>
                <li>Developing REST APIs in Node.js using Express.js, Axios and MongoDB, testing them using Mocha and
                    deploying them as containers using Git, Jenkins and Docker.
                </li>

                <li>Building full-stack applications and keeping up with the latest javascript frameworks and releases.
                </li>

                <li>Problem solving using OOP in Java and C#.
                </li>

                <li>Implementing machine learning algorithms using Python.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, I like to solve challenging problems on competitive coding websites, work on my personal
                projects and play board games.
            </p>
